// 1. Ask the user to type in fruit or veggie.
// If they say fruit, ask them to choose a or b.
// If they say a, print out apple. If they say b, print out banana.
// If they said veggie at the beginning, ask them to choose m or p.
// If they say m, print out mushroom. If they say p, print out pepper.

var readline = require("readline-sync");

var food  =	readline.question("type in fruit or veggies");
if(food == "fruit"){
	var fruit = readline.question("apples or oranges")
	if(fruit == "apples"){
		console.log("apple");

	}else{
		console.log("oranges");
	}
}
if(food =="veggies"){
	var veggies = readline.question("write m or p ==->");
	if(veggies == "m"){

// 2. Ask the user to choose square or rectangle.
// Also ask them to choose area or perimeter.

// BONUS CHALLENGE
// 3. Pretend you are running a fast food shop.
// Start out with the line let totalCost = 0;
// Ask the user if they want a value meal, or if they will order individual items.
// If they want a value meal, ask if they want the burger ($7) or the chicken ($6).
// Add the amount to totalCost, then tell them how much they owe.
// If they want individual items, ask them (one item at a time)
//     if they want burger ($4), fries ($2), drink ($1), dessert ($2).
// Each time they say yes, add the right amount to the totalCost.
// At the end, tell them how much they owe.
