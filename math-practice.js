// Under each question, write the code that solves it, and then write your answer in a comment
// For example, if the question is: What's the sum of 79 and 2018 you would write:
// console.log(79 + 2018);
// 2097

// Some of the questions will use these variables
// const p = 12;
// const q = 60;
// const r = 25;

// 1. Is 91 divisible by 13? (The answer should be either true or false)
//console.log(91/13);
			// true
// 2. What is the result when the q divided by r is rounded to the nearest integer?
	//console.log(60/25);
				// 2.4
// 3. Is the product of p and r greater than q squared? (The answer should be either true or false)
//	console.log((27 * 25) - 60**2)
			// false
// 4. What is the remainder when the sum of q and r is divided by p?
	// console.log((60+25)%12);
				// 1
// 5. 27 squared is equal to what number raised to the third power?
		// console.log(Math.cbrt(729));
		// 9
// 6. What is the absolute value of p - q? (Find out how to do absolute value by searching online.)
 	//console.log(Math.abs(12-60));
 	//48
// 7. Find another math operation we haven't talked about yet on the MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) and try it out below.
var num1 = 3;
var num2 = 52;
var num3 = num2 % num1;
num1 = num3 - 1;
console.log(num1);
