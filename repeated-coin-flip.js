// Use a for loop to simulate flipping a coin 100 times.

// Think carefully about how you could use Math.random() or random-int to do this.

// (There are several possible answers.)

// Keep track of how many of the flips are heads.

// Print out the total number of flips and the total number of heads at the end.

// How often is it exactly 50/100? Fun fact: this should only happen about 8% of the time.
let hTracker = 0;
let tTracker = 0;
let ran = Math.random();
let zip = 0;
for(i = 0;i<=100;i++){
 ran = Math.random();
	if(0.5<ran){
		hTracker++;

	}
	 else if(0.5>ran){
		tTracker++;
	}


}
console.log("you got heads " + hTracker);
console.log("you got tails " + tTracker);
